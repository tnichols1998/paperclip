// Optional Sentry error-report integration for the server process.
//
// Activated only when `SENTRY_DSN` is set. When unset, no Sentry package is
// loaded at all. The `@sentry/node` package is an optional dependency, so a
// self-hoster who wants error reports installs it explicitly. That keeps Sentry
// off the default dependency graph, the same way `instrumentation.ts` keeps the
// OpenTelemetry packages optional.
//
// The integration has two operator-selected trust levels. The operator sets the
// level with `SENTRY_TRUST_LEVEL`. The value is `high` or `low`. The default is
// `low`. The level comes only from the environment at process start. No request
// input can change the level.
//
// - The low-trust level is the default. It runs when `SENTRY_TRUST_LEVEL` is
//   absent, `low`, or unrecognized. It sends a minimal, fail-closed event: the
//   redacted error plus a narrow typed context. It never sends the request
//   body, the headers, the cookies, the caller IP address, the user identity,
//   or the local variables.
// - The high-trust level runs only when the operator sets `SENTRY_TRUST_LEVEL`
//   to `high`. It sends richer debug data: the SDK-captured request metadata,
//   the breadcrumbs, the error context, and the stack-frame local variables. It
//   still keeps `sendDefaultPii: false`, so it does not send the cookies, the
//   caller IP address, or the user identity. It still removes secrets from every
//   event.
//
// Both levels run a secret-redaction pass over every event. Paperclip must never
// send its own secrets to a third party, at either level.
